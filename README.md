# PCA-Compression-and-Visualization-Jupyter-Notebook-

During this project, we will perform K Means clustering on the well known Iris data set, which contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. To visualize the clusters, we will use principle component analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of features in the dataset.

We will cover:

* The KMeans Clustering Elbow Method
* Principle Component Analysis with Scikit-Learn
* Meshgrid Visualizations for PCA-reduced Data
